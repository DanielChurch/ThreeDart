### Work in progress
:seedling: ThreeDart is currently a work in progress.

### Running tests
1. Run `pub serve` from ThreeDart root directory.
2. Open `http://localhost:8081/` in a browser.
    * Recommend Chromium/Dartium for fast tests and better dart debugging.
    * Chrome and Firefox also works well, however it will take a while to load pages while Dart transpiles.
    * Not tested nor recommended for use on other browsers at this time.
